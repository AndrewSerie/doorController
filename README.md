# doorController [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AndrewSerie/doorController.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/AndrewSerie/doorController/)

Door Controller is an arduino program written to feed data to the NodeMCU LUA ESP8266 module for status updates and other neat things.

## Notes
This program is written to benefit my system.  This is not neccessarily a plug and play program.
Feel free to use the code for example purposes or to write your own version of the code for your system!

## Usage
Modify the code to fit your system.
This was written to be used by a standalone ESP8266 board.  No arduino was used.
